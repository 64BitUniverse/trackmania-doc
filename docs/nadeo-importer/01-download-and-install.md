# Download and install

## How to install Nadeo Importer

First download the **importer zip** file, and also the **sample zip** file if you are interested (see below for the download links).

> **Note for Chrome users**: If left-clicking on the download links has no effect, try to right-click on it and select `Open link in new tab` in the context menu.

The importer must be unzipped in the `{Trackmania_exe_dir}` folder, which is the folder that contains `Trackmania.exe`, typically `C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games\Trackmania` or `C:\Program Files\Trackmania`.
You might neeed administrator rights to unzip and place the importer files in there.

> This will add some files to your `{Trackmania_exe_dir}` folder, but the most important one is `NadeoImporter.exe`.
> 
> See section [How to import an item] to learn how to use this executable properly.

The sample files are not mandatory, but provide examples that can help you: you can unzip them in the `{Trackmania_user_dir}` folder, which is typically `{My Documents}\Trackmania`.
This will create the folder `{Trackmania_user_dir}\Work\Items\Samples` and fill it with source assets, ready to be imported.
