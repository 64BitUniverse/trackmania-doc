# How can I play previous seasonal campaigns?

!!! info "Paid access required"

    This feature requires an active or expired **Standard Access** or **Club Access** subscription.

## Explanation
To play previous seasonal campaigns, head on over to the `Play -> Solo` menu and in the top left you will find a button that, by clicking it, lets you cycle through the previous seasonal campaigns. Leaderboards on previous campaign are closed by default, meaning you cannot earn trophies for your position in them anymore.

In case you previously had _Standard Access_ or _Club Access_, only the current seasonal campaign and all campaigns released by the time your subscription ran out will be available for you to play.
