# Royal Map Pool

The tracks, that are in the current Royal and Super Royal map pool can be found on the [official Trackmania website](https://www.trackmania.com/royal).

At the bottom of that page, you can also find a link to a history with a calendar interface which shows when a specific map was added to map pool.

New tracks will be added to the Royal map pool every week on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays at 20:00 Central European (Summer) Time.
