# What is Royal?

Royal is a team-based (maximum 3 players per team) knockout mode taking place on five maps. Four of the maps are randomly selected from a pool of 30 maps, and one of the maps will always be the latest map added to the map pool. You can view the current map pool [here](https://www.trackmania.com/royal).

## Maps 
Royal maps are comprised of 5 sections, each with increasing difficulty. The colors indicate the difficulty in the same order as the seasonal campaigns (white, green, blue, red, black). Royal maps usually involve moving objects, tricks, and air and speed control. 

3 new tracks are added to the [map pool](https://www.trackmania.com/royal) every week on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.

## Gameplay
When the round starts, each team is placed on the white section of the track. If you or one of your teammates finishes the section you are on, your team will move onto the next section, unless you are on the black section. For the black section, it will keep looping every time your team finishes it. Every time a player finishes a section, regardless of color, one second of bonus time is added to your team with a maximum of 5 per player. Bonus time is used at the very end of the round, after the timer ends. The team that completes the most segments wins the round, and the teams that finish the least amount of sections get knocked out. The number of teams getting knocked out is dependent of the number of teams remaining. For most matches, it is 3 or 4 teams getting knocked out each round.
