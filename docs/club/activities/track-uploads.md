The *Track Uploads* activity can be used to share tracks with either the public or members of the club.

## Create a track uploads activity

**Note:** You will not be able to add tracks yet when creating a track uploads activity, to do this you have to interact with the activity on the club page after it is created.

To create a *Track Uploads* activity the only thing that is required is a name for the activity, optionally you can also choose to add an image to the activity.

The *'+'* button is used to select an image for the activity, the name can be entered in the textbox.
After choosing a name and an optional image you can punlish the activity to the club by selecting the "Create" Button.

To add tracks to the *Track Uploads* activity simply select it from the homepage of the club and select the "Upload a Track" button.
From here you can choose one or more tracks from the [Track Browser](17_Campaign.md#adding-maps).
