# What is a Campaign

A *campaign* is a collection of up to 25 tracks with it's own leaderboard.

## Create a campaign

When you select the option to create a campaign the following menu will appear:

This menu has the following options:
1. Add a thumbnail for the campaign.
2. Change the name of the campaign.
3. Set the access for the campaign to public or members of the club only.
4. Add one or more maps to the campaign.
5. Finalize and publish the campaign.

## Adding maps

Choosing to add maps to the campaign will open the *Track Browser*.

From here you can select maps from your *My Tracks*, *Favorites*, *Official* (maps from the official campaigns and track of the day) and *Clubs* (maps from campaigns of clubs you've joined).
