# Play others' maps.

In order to review other players' maps and join the track review
server, you must navigate from the main menu to **CREATE**, then
**TRACK REVIEW**, and finally **REVIEW OTHER TRACKS**. Once
selecting **REVIEW OTHER TRACKS**, you will be able to select
whether you want to review maps for **TRACK OF THE DAY** or
**ROYAL**.

Once choosing a map review type, you will then be moved to a review
server, where you will be able to test other players\' maps and give
them a rating from 1-5 stars.

These ratings will be seen by map selectors from Ubisoft Nadeo and based on the
amount of reviews, will decide whether the map is qualified to be either
a Track of the Day, or a Royal Map.
