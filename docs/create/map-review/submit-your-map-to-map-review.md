# Submit your map to map review

In order to submit your map to be reviewed, you must navigate from the
main menu to **CREATE**, then **TRACK REVIEW**, and finally
**SUBMIT YOUR TRACKS**. Once selecting **SUBMIT YOUR TRACKS**,
you will be able to select a map of your choice to be submitted to
either **TRACK OF THE DAY** or **ROYAL**. A more specific
description on how to submit tracks can be found in the "Map Review
Section" under **Navigating the menus**.

Once choosing a map, you will then be given an estimated maximum waiting
time, and which game mode you have selected to submit the map to.

You can then press the **SEND FOR REVIEW** button, which will insert
your map into the map review server, where other players can test/play
your map, and ultimately give a 1-5 star review.
